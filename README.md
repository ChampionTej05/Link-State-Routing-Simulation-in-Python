# Link-State-Routing-Simulation-in-Python
This is the simple demonstration of LSP algorithm in networking, which is dynamic routing algorithm.

# Instructions to Execute the code:
1. Basic instructions are already provided in the code file
2. You have to use input file to feed input to the algorithm in order to simulate it.
3. Sample input are provided to guide about how to create the your own input file.
4. You can also break the certain link and check how algorithm find out the new path according to the information that is provided.
